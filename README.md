## GAMEPLAY

The game involves a ridiculous plot about a Red Guy who is hungry and is looking for diamond to have for lunch. He has requested help from his friends: Green Guy and Yellow Guy. Together, they will solve puzzles, avoid deadly hazards, and collect keys and push blocks around to help sate their hunger for shiny rocks.

This is a mouse-driven game and doesn't rely on twitch reflexes, so you can take your time over solving the levels.

There are 100 levels in total, each trickier than the last.
